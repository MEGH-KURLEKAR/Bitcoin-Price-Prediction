# ‚Çø Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project applies machine learning techniques to forecast Bitcoin price trends using historical market data. It evaluates the performance of multiple classification models, including Logistic Regression, SVC, and XGBoost, to predict whether Bitcoin prices will rise or fall based on engineered features.

## üìå Project Goals

- Build a supervised ML pipeline to predict Bitcoin price direction.
- Engineer relevant features using historical data (e.g., price changes, volatility).
- Compare model performance using classification metrics.
- Visualize insights to support decision-making in crypto trading.

## üß™ Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- XGBoost Classifier

Each model is evaluated using:
- ROC-AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, and F1 Score

## üìä Libraries & Tools

- Python 3.x
- pandas, numpy
